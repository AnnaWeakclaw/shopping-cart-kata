## Simple Checkout

Write the code for a supermarket checkout that can calculate the price of any number of items taken from a predetermined list.
Each item should be priced individually, and the checkout should be able to scan them in any order.

The requirements for the system are as follows:

<p>As a shopper<br>
So I know how much an item costs<br>
I would like to be able to see its price</p>

<p>As a shopper<br>
So that I can buy an item<br>
I would like to be able to scan items at the checkout</p>

<p>As a shopper <br>
So that I know if I have made a mistake<br>
I should be informed if I attempt to buy an item which is not available</p>

<p>As a shopper<br>
So that I know how much to pay<br>
I would like to be able to see a total for all scanned items</p>

<p>As a shopper<br>
So that I know how much to pay<br>
I would like to see all prices correctly formatted (Â£xx.xx)</p>

<p>As a shopper<br>
So that I am not left out of pocket<br>
I would like to receive the correct change once I have completed my transaction</p>
